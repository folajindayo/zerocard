# ZeroCard App Flow Document

## Application Structure Overview

ZeroCard's mobile application follows a streamlined user journey designed to minimize friction while providing a comprehensive cryptocurrency spending solution. This document details each screen within the application and the user's journey through these screens.

## Onboarding Flow

### Splash Screen
The first screen users see when opening the app. It displays the ZeroCard logo and tagline. After a brief animation lasting 2 seconds, new users are directed to the Welcome screen while returning authenticated users are directed to the Home screen.

### Welcome Screen
This screen introduces ZeroCard's value proposition with concise text and illustrative graphics explaining how the platform works. It features a prominent "Get Started" button that directs users to the Authentication screen. A smaller "Already have an account?" link is available for returning users.

### Authentication Screen
Powered by Privy, this screen offers email, social, and wallet-based authentication options. Users select their preferred authentication method and complete the required steps. Upon successful authentication, first-time users are directed to the Username Selection screen while returning users proceed to the Home screen.

### Username Selection Screen
First-time users create a unique username that will be used for their Basename identity. The screen includes a text input field with real-time availability checking and validation. The username must be at least 3 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. After selecting a valid username, users proceed to the KYC Verification screen.

### KYC Verification Screen
Users complete KYC verification by providing their Bank Verification Number (BVN). The screen includes an input field for the BVN and brief instructions on where to find it. After submitting a valid BVN, the system validates the information and, upon success, users are directed to the Wallet Creation screen.

### Wallet Creation Screen
This screen shows an animation of the wallet creation process. Behind the scenes, the system creates a smart wallet for the user based on their authentication and KYC information. The screen displays progress steps: "Creating your smart wallet," "Securing your wallet," and "Wallet ready!" Once complete, users are directed to the Home screen.

## Core Application Flow

### Home Screen
The central hub of the application displaying the user's stablecoin balance prominently at the top. The screen includes a card status widget showing whether the user has an active card or needs to order one. Below the balance, there's a transaction history section showing recent transactions with merchant names, amounts, and timestamps. The bottom navigation bar provides access to other main sections: Wallet, Card, and Profile.

This screen displays detailed wallet information and functions. At the top, users see their current balance in their selected stablecoin (USDT or USDC) with a toggle to switch between them. Below is a "Load Wallet" button that takes users to the Deposit screen. The screen also includes a complete transaction history with filtering options by date, amount, and transaction type.

### Deposit Screen
Users can add funds to their wallet from this screen. It provides options to deposit via connected DeFi wallet or external crypto transfer. For external transfers, the screen displays the wallet address as text and QR code. For DeFi wallet connections, users can select from their connected wallets and specify the amount to transfer. The screen includes clear instructions and confirmation steps to complete the deposit.

### Card Ordering Screen
First-time card users or those replacing cards access this screen to order a physical ZeroCard. The screen collects shipping information including full name, address, city, state, postal code, and country. Users confirm the information before proceeding to order placement. The screen clearly indicates that only one active card is permitted per account.

### Card Status Screen
After ordering a card, users can check their card status on this screen. It displays the current status (Processing, Shipped, Delivered) with estimated timelines. Once delivered, the status changes to "Ready to Activate" with instructions to scan the physical card.

### Card Activation Screen
This screen uses the device camera and OpenCV technology to scan and verify the physical card. Users are prompted to position their card within a designated area on the screen. Upon successful scanning, the system maps the card to the user's wallet, and they are directed to the Card Management screen.

### Card Management Screen
Users can manage their card settings from this screen. It displays the card details (masked card number, expiration date) and toggle switches for enabling/disabling different transaction types: ATM withdrawals, POS transactions, and online purchases. The screen also includes a prominent "Freeze Card" button for quickly disabling all card functions in case of loss or theft.

### Transaction Details Screen
Accessed by tapping on any transaction in the history list, this screen provides comprehensive details about a specific transaction. Information includes merchant name, transaction date and time, amount in both crypto and local currency, transaction type, and status. For pending transactions, an estimated completion time is shown.

## Secondary Flows

### Wallet Withdrawal Screen
Users can withdraw crypto from their wallet to external addresses. The screen includes fields for the destination address (with QR scanning capability), amount selection, and transaction fee information. Users must confirm the withdrawal with an authentication step before it processes.

### Card Replacement Flow
